Before questions: AX's work flow start with asking questions. But my mind is 100% empty before asking any questions. To avoid of asking skilly questions, or recite questions provided by masters, I need to summarize my thoughts first. Here are questions to myself: What am I going to implement, a service? a job/cron job? an API? ok, for a rate limiter, it is more of a service. For myself, I don't need to ask whether it is a client side or server side or middle ware. Middle ware it is. why? In real world implementation, you can never expect how user will f**k up your precious software. Server side? we will always need to decouple the new service from the old service. AX's server side to me is more of a cloud side. Limiter throttle based on what? detailed requirements, won't firstly come up to my mind, but also great question to ask. Scale of the system? Always remember to ask the scale of system. Or we can always start from very tiny number of user. Distributed environment? No idea what is this separate service or in code? always separate service. It will make the process easier, and no need to touch the current running code. notify user detailed design that we don't care Sum up: Question must ask: scale! give assumption, start from small, and scale to large boundary of the feature: what else besides rate limiting: notify user? think aloud on: any detailed design coming up to mind, take notes
